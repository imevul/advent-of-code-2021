# Advent of Code 2021

Here are a few working examples in PHP for the 2021 version of [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2021).

## Running
The solution for all days can be run from the command line, ex:

	php day1/day1.php

Sometimes, the code needs to be modified slightly for part 1 vs part 2.
If so, it's usually a very obvious change in the initialization part of the code.
